# Templates
In this folder we have the HTML templates. Flask is using Jinja, so we can load these templates into Python functions which return `str`'s and inherit base templates to create a standard look and feel. Flask will serve these templates over the webserver to whoever requests them and fill in the information in the background to create web pages. We also have the ability to use `if then else` blocks and `for` loops within these templates.
